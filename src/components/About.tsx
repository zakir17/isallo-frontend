      <p className="mission">
        Our mission at isallo is to promote societal transformation and healing
        through moments of daily introspection. This genuine, internal
        metamorphosis begins where emotion and logic meet. By identifying our
        feelings and emotions, verbalizing the stories we&apos;ve formed about
        our experiences, and evaluating our emotional trends over time, we open
        the door for the true evolution of self.
